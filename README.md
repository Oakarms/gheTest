# ghetestrepo

Used for integration testing SAST, so there is a safe target for notifications and feedback, etc.
This particular repo differs from the other testrepo, in that it is intended for testing the
git-eng.target.com GitHub test environment.  This is the only repo that should be wired up to
the GHE version of the GitHub application.  When the RAPID team refreshes git-eng.target.com
based on git.target.com, the GitHub application and this repo will come along with, and we'll
be able to test.
